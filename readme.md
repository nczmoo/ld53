MAYBE
    You can get to know people before the sermon.
    when a person has an emotional response, a person seated next to them having a similar response amplifies it.    
    create a second set of green / red for polarity section so players can see where they're at
    maybe as you're talking positively and negatively about these topics, you inspire your parish to do actual events outside of church.
